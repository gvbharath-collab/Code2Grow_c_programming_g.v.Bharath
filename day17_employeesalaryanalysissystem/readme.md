The Employee Salary Analysis System is a simple C program that helps analyze the salaries of up to 10 employees using arrays, loops, and conditional statements. It first collects the student’s name, registration number, and section, then asks the user to enter employee salaries. Through a menu, the user can view all salaries, find total and average pay, identify the highest and lowest salaries, count employees earning above or below average, and display the salaries in ascending order using bubble sort. The program repeats until the user chooses to exit, showing the student’s details in every output for personalization.
