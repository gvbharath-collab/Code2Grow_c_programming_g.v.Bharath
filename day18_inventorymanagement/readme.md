This C program implements a simple inventory management system for up to 10 products. It stores each product’s ID, name, quantity, and price using arrays. The user first enters the number of products and their details. A menu-driven loop then enables the user to:

Display all product data along with the calculated value for each item.

Compute and show the total value of the inventory.

Identify which product has the highest and lowest total worth.

Search for a product by its ID.

All calculations and searches are handled using loops and conditional statements. The program also validates inputs and provides relevant outputs based on the selected menu option. The design ensures user-friendly navigation and accurate reporting of inventory details.
